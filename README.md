# Hubot Script Packages

If you would like to have your Hubot Script Package grouped under the
Hubot Scripts organization (so it can be found easily by others), open an issue
on this repository with a link to your Hubot Script Package.

We'll review your package and if everything is in top shape we'll fork it to the
Hubot Scripts organization and give you read and write access to the fork. You
will still be the maintainer, you'll still own the issues and pull requests. It
will just be available under the Hubot Scripts organization for users to find
more easily.
