# Hubot Script Packages

**DEPRECATED**

If you would like to have your Hubot Script Package grouped under the
Hubot Scripts organization (so it can be found easily by others), this used to be the place
to open an issue to get it added to this organization.

Instead, you should keep your package on your own user or organization and publish it to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Looking for scripts? You can search NPM for scripts on the command line with:

     npm search hubot-scripts <your-search-term>.
